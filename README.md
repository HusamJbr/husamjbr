## Projects

I have a proven ability to efficiently develop large projects. Here are some examples of my recent work:

- [Chess game](https://github.com/HusamJbr/chess-game): They have created a comprehensive chess game application using the Java programming language, adhering to industry-standard design patterns, clean code, and SOLID principles. The application was built with an architecture that follows the principles of maintainability, scalability, and extensibility. The codebase is managed using Git, which allows for easy collaboration and version control. The application includes all standard chess game rules and can be easily extended to incorporate new game modes and variations, due to the use of behavioral design patterns in its structure.
- [Web server in java](https://github.com/HusamJbr/httpserver): A web server was designed and developed from scratch, with the capability of serving static resources and the ability to be easily extended to handle dynamic resources. The Producer-consumer model was utilized to ensure thread safety and manage the number of active threads. Furthermore, HTTP specifications were studied to construct appropriate responses and effectively process incoming requests.
